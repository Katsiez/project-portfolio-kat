# Katarina's first ever portfolio 👩‍💻

💻 This is my very first portfolio containing some of my projects that I have been working on. For this first version, I have only included some of my projects and intend to add and delete articles as I progress as a front end developer.

The skills and tech sections are pre-filled as I needed to include some content there.
Blog posts are coming in their due time.

📱 This project is responsive on all devices and screen-reader accessibility has been tested in Chrome, using the extension ChromeVox Classic Extension and iPhone voice reader.

HTML has been validated using https://validator.w3.org/ and the errors have been fixed during this process. Both HTML, as well as CSS have been formatted properly using an online tool: https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html
